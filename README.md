# Ziggurat
A GUI-based text editor written in zig. Mainly intended as a learning project and ideally skills demo.

The name isn't that meaningful, just a play on zig and the idea of building functionality in solid discrete layers. The hope is that most components are well built and self-sufficient enough to be viable as standalone imports to other projects.
